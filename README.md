# Aero-Lux-Airlines
AeroLux Airlines – Premium Flight Booking .A sleek, responsive airline booking website with glassmorphism design, seat selection UI, dark/light mode, form validation, and interactive features. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Presenting Our Second year college mini project of airplane ticketing system. Initially designed back then in C Programming Language now redesigned it by giving it a Web UI with a front end development . Got a help from ChatGPT and some other AI tools to convert the exact logic of C code in Javascript and enhanced and styled it beautifully using CSS 
Our team worked hard as to gain initial hands on experience with front end devlopment understanding all the features , methods , design essentials we redesigned it in Web development.
Still its being a prototype there are many improvements in the project . Will be implementing in a Full-Stack project soon. Meanwhile, take a look at the design and development.
